                        We did some digging into the capital’s steak joints (tough job) to make sure you’ll never sit
                        through a sub-standard chop again Any eatery that wants to serve you steak has nowhere to hide:
                        the meat must be fabulous, the fire it's cooked on searing, the accompaniments harmonious.
                        London is a city of restaurants and it's also a city of cacophonous steaks: it's all too easy to
                        think it'll be a bold statement and instead wish you'd never gone there at all.
                    </p>
                    <p>But the city also contains some of the best sirloins and chateaubriands in the world: from USDA
                        beef to Britain's finest, from Australia to South America, the great and the good of
                        international cow carving have set up camp in the big smoke. If you want to get the best steak
                        in the capital, there are plenty of diamonds hiding in the rough. Read our list below the next
                        time you want to live like a carnivore and you will, rest assured, never put a foot wrong.

                    <p><strong>Why go? </strong>Located in Belgravia’s slick new development, Eccleston Yards, which
                        prides itself on being a “wellbeing hub”, The Jones Family Kitchen is, in many ways, an
                        extension of the original Shoreditch outpost, but with a slightly more relaxed vibe. Renowned
                        for their melt in your mouth steaks, but with enough options to keep any vegans you might be
                        dining with happy (not to mention their fully accredited gluten-free menu), the venue
                        brilliantly combines a classic steakhouse vibe with a thoroughly modern twist.
                    </p>
                    <p>Of course, The Jones Family Kitchen’s heroes are their steak dishes, but don’t leave without
                        trying the truffle mac and cheese and, for dessert, Anna’s triple chocolate brownie accompanied
                        by cornflake ice cream... Seriously, once you’ve tasted that ice cream, it will linger on your
                        mind for days – weeks, even – and is almost as much of a draw to the restaurant as the meat.</p>
                    <p><strong>What's the steak like? </strong>When we visited and took our first mouthfuls of steak,
                        everyone at the table had just one thing to say: “wow”. Sourced from the famed The Ginger Pig
                        butchers and immaculately caramelised on a Josper grill, the meat somehow manages to be even
                        more tender than you’d hoped it would be, making for a truly unforgettable meal. Pair with the
                        black garlic chimichurri and you’ll throw your head back in pleasure. Yes, it’s that good.</p>

                        standing out in New York: yet Smith & Wollensky have managed to succeed on both sides of the
                        pond, and for good reason</p>
                    <p>Since it was established in 1977, Smith & Wollensky has focused on providing you with opulent
                        settings and delicious food, with a focus on America’s finest: 2/3 of their wine list is
                        American, and their menu features both British cattle and the finest USDA beef. From its art
                        deco interior to the seasoning of its sides to the quality of the plonk, Smith & Wollensky wants
                        you to have the best possible version of a steak eating. And honey: you’re going to bloody get
                        it. Stick around, if you can, for a Bruce Bogtrotter-ready slice of chocolate cake, meant to be
                        shared by up to 4 people and the size of most heads.</p>
                    <p><strong>What's the steak like? </strong>Thanks to the meat being cooked in a charbroiler at
                        1000F, the meat is charred and gnarly on the outside and velveteen in the middle. The USDA beef
                        in particular- corn-fed, younger and more tender- slaps hard, in particular larger cuts like
                        tomahawks or cote d’boeuf (they also readily encourage gnawing on the bones.) If you get a
                        chance to try their Wagyu too, do: whenever it appears, it’s worth experiencing what is,
                        genuinely, just butter on your tongue.</p>

                    <p><strong>Why go? </strong>The ever-expanding Temper empire (Tempire?) varies its offerings
                        depending on where you go, but always the aim is the same: a blitzkrieg of bold, left-field
                        flavours drawing on a varied selection of international cuisines. At their Covent Garden branch,
                        Temper’s usual focus on grilled meats and flatbreads also expands to include gamechangingly good
                        detroit style pizzas: imagine a grandma slice souped up by ten thousand times. Their exceptional
                        tacos remain intact, as does Temper’s almost unparalleled desserts: from the former, the
                        Cheeseburger and the al pastor are unparalleled; the skillet cookie with fior de latte ice cream
                        and the bananaramadrama are worth booking a reservation alone.</p>
                    <p><strong>What's the steak like? </strong>Charred via their audaciously fiery set-up in the middle
                        of the restaurant, the steak comes perfectly seasoned with just the right mix of gnarl and
                        yield. Their 90-day aged steak (we went for the t-bone) fits perfectly with everything else they
                        do: the vegetal funk means each bite is complex and audacious without needing anything else… but
                        the chimichurri and chipotle mayo on the side are still very welcome.</p>

                        Flat Iron too slight, Blacklock provides the right blend of meat, cocktails and smoke. If beef

                        less, to match the different tastes. Not that we're complaining, since great wine accompanied
                        even better food. The pièces de résistances were of course, the different cuts of steak, all
                        neatly arranged on one large plate. (As you may have realised, Boyd's doesn't go easy on
                        portions.) The dessert (for which you must adjourn to its own separate seating area) is,
                        however, perhaps the best bit of the whole experience. Why? Because the concept is to let you
                        try every single flavour of home-made ice-cream they have made that day, which can be as many as
                        24 flavours. Say when...</p>

                        establishment does one thing (very) well. Accompanied by its signature salad starter and frites
                        cut by hand to a specific width, the real magic of Le Renais de Venise lies in its famous
                        "secret recipe" steak sauce; the ingredients remaining a mystery since its inception in 1959.
                        Visitors should expect second helpings, ensuring you enjoy your steak frites at their best.
                        Frenchman Paul Gineste de Saurs opened the original restaurant in Paris and since, it has become
                        something of an institution. If you’re a regular, you’ll refer to it simply as "L’Entrecote".
                        Today there are four branches in London, still being run by the daughter of the founder M de
                        Saurs, Madame Helene Godillot.

                        Grade 9, Ÿa novel take on the ageing process that, following its adoption in this country by GQ
                        Food and Drink shortlisted restaurant Kitty Fisher’s, allegedly caused Spanish diary farmers to
                        inundate the country’s abattoirs with elderly members of their milking herds. Fear not, as
                        Lurra’s Grade 9 (non-dairy cow derived) beef is exceptional: flamed to perfection on a wood
                        grill and served very simply with its fat intact (important). Plus, it’s a great environment in
                        which to linger, with a cool, cosmopolitan Euro décor and good, young staff.
