-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The main colours used are black, gray and white provided by bootstrap.
    -   #### Typography
        -    I used the default bootstrap font-family Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma. The font is used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. I think this font is a clean and it is used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery is important. I used imgs(free lincence) and I used photoshop to make them web-friendly(resizing them).
