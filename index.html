            The age of the remote worker is here to stay. Between people working from home because of the pandemic and freelancers who always did, a huge part of London's workforce isn't office based. The number of self-employment has increased a lot in London in recent years, rising by 37% since 2008 (compared to 25% across England). Whatever the reason, working hours and locations are becoming more flexible and we love it.
          </p>
          <p>With these changes comes an increasing need for interesting and inspiring places to work in the capital. Here, we take a look at the 15 of the best spots to work remotely in London.

          <p>If you’re planning on converting a skateboard you already own into an eboard, then you won’t need to shop
            for decks. If you’re building a board from scratch, you’ll want to consider the wheelbase, deck flex, and
            deck shape.</p>
          <p>The wheelbase is the space you’ll have on the underside of the board for all your components: motor, ESC,
            battery, and anything else you want to attach. That includes all the wiring you’ll need, and that takes up
            more space than most people realize.</p>
          <p>The deck flex can become a problem for your battery. You don’t want to mount solid parts where the deck
            flexes, but the flex is also crucial to a smooth ride. It’s a balancing act; you want enough flex to keep
            the ride comfortable, but you don’t want to damage your battery or motor. You can mitigate the potential
            flex problems by mounting the battery and motor closer to the wheels, since the middle of the deck is the
            area that bends the most.
          <p>
          <p>Bear in mind that the more flexible the deck, the less responsive the board is at high speed. Your eboard
            is going to move a lot fast than a regular skateboard; you may not want much flex in the deck.</p>
          <p>Deck shape will affect how you mount the parts and how the board rides. Concave decks are great for foot
            stability, but they’ll make mounting a motor and battery more difficult because of the curve. A deck with a
            large camber (the upward bend between the trucks) will present the same problems as a flexible deck, because
            decks with camber are inherently flexible.</p>
          <p>A deck with a rocker shape is one that bends down between the trucks. This is off limits for eboards,
            because it would drag your expensive electronic parts along the ground.</p>

          <p>If you’re building your first electronic board, and you’re starting to feel intimidated or confused by all
            the different components you need to buy, you should consider buying a kit.</p>
          <p>An electric skateboard kit will come with everything you need except for the deck, which you’ll have to buy
            separately unless you have an old board you want to convert.</p>
          <p>A kit might cost more than buying the parts separately, and you won’t be able to completely customize your
            board, but you’ll know that you have all the parts you need and that they’re all compatible with each other.
            That’s a significant consideration for you if it’s your first build. If you buy the parts separately, you
            have to be certain that each part is compatable with every other part, and you have to take the time to
            research each individual component to ensure that you’re getting the right balance of cost and quality. A
            kit guarantees that every part will work with all the others and it saves you a lot of time researching the
            parts.</p>
          <p>Kits should also come with a thorough installation guide, making it even easier for first-timers to use.
            This is a helpful buying guide if you’re interested in purchasing a kit.</p>

          <p>You’ve purchased all the parts for your board, now it’s time to put everything together.</p>
          <p>To start, set the deck top down and lay all the components on top of the deck, to be certain everything
            will fit in the layout you want. You may need to move the trucks if you’re using a shorter board; this will
            require you to drill through the deck.</p>
          <p>The first step is to mount the trucks and the motors. This is all one step if you’re using hub drives. The
            video below goes into detail on the whole process of assembling and installing the drive train on your
            board, including a list of all the tools you need. Your motor probably came with an installation guide, but
            the video is useful for seeing assembly in action.</p>
          <p>When attaching the motor to the motor mount, it’s helpful to place the mount on the truck so you can see
            the best way to affix the motor to the mount; there are multiple positions you can install it in depending
            on which direction you want the wires to go. It’s a good idea to use thread lock glue on the screws
            attaching the motor to the mount.</p>
          <p>To attach the pulley gear to your wheel, you’ll probably need to drill a hole in the wheel for the bolts.
            Some wheels will have pre-drilled holes, but you may still need to widen them. Use thread lock on the bolts
            for the pulley gear, too.</p>
          <p>Slide the motor into position on the truck, and slightly tighten the fastening screw. Put the pullet belt
            on the motor, and slide the wheel onto the truck. Slowly rotate the wheel while attaching the pulley belt to
            it.</p>
          <p>If you’re using hub motors, the process is a lot simpler. The motor is embedded in the wheel, so you need
            to make sure that your motor/wheel will fit on your truck. If it fits, then it’s just like putting new
            wheels onto the truck. It’s even easier if you buy hub motors with their own trucks included.</p>
          <p>Now you can finish installing your wheels and trucks just like you would on a normal skateboard. Then, you
            can start installing the battery and the ESC.</p>
          <p>You’ll probably need to drill holes in your case for the wiring. Drill the holes small, and gradually widen
            them with larger drill bits to avoid cracking the plastic. You might also need to drill holes for a power
            switch and a charging port, depending on the case you bought.</p>
          <p>Place the case in the exact spot you want it to be in the final build, and clamp it down. Once it’s secured
            in place, locate the built-in screw holes and drill through them into the deck. Once the holes are drilled
            drop screws into the holes to keep the case in place while you remove clamps to access the remaining screw
            holes.
          </p>
          <p>It’s a good idea to use a countersink drill bit on each hole you drill. This ensures that each screw sits
            flush with the deck and won’t cause bumps in your grip tape.</p>
          <p>Now, place the ESC and battery into your case. Connect the charge port to the battery, connect the power
            switch to the ESC, and then connect the battery to the ESC.</p>
          <p>Next you want to feed the motor wires into the case through the holes you’ve already drilled. Connect these
            wires to the ESC. Make sure you test everything before you seal the case down. To do that, grab your
            controller and hold down the throttle; if you’ve done everything right, the motor should kick in and the
            wheels should spin.
          </p>
          <p>If everything worked properly, you’re ready to seal up your case and start riding.</p>

            We want to have fun and meet people that share our same interests.
